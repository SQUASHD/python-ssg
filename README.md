# Python Static Site Generator

A guided project from [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) involving building
a static site generator from scratch using python.

## Chapters

1. **Static Sites**:
Learn about what a static site is, and start building the functionality necessary to process and move static HTML and Markdown files.

2. **Nodes**:
Build the core HTML generation logic that will power your static site generator. Use recursion and OOP to build an easily understandable and maintainable system.

3. **Inline**:
Build the inline markdown parsing logic, and the logic to generate inline HTML elements.

4. **Blocks**:
Handle entire blocks of markdown, and generate the HTML nodes that represent them.

5. **Website**:
Put the entire static site generator together, and publish your first website.
